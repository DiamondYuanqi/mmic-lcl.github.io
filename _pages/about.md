Biography
======
I received the master and PhD degrees from Anhui University at Jun. 2013 and Jun. 2016, supervised by Prof. Bin Luo and Prof. Jin Tang respectively. In Jul. 2017 - Mar. 2019, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), working with Prof. [Liang Wang](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/liangwang/). In Jun. 2014 - Sep. 2015, I worked as a visiting student at Sun Yat-Sen University, supervised by Prof. [Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/). My research interests are computer vision and deep learning.
